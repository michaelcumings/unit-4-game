Crystal Collector!

A Unit 4 assignment in the UMN Full Stack Web Development
Coding Boot Camp program, coded by Michael Cumings

Features
The game has buttons marked by 4 different crystals, and 
Bootstrap buttons/badges with counters for Target Score, Total 
Score, Wins, and Losses.  The game will choose 4 unique values 
from 1-12 for each crystal button, and a number from 19 to 120 
for the Target Score.  Each time a button is pressed, the value 
of the crystal will be added to the Total Score.  If at any 
point the Target Score equals the Total Score, the player wins, 
the win counter is updated, and the game starts again.  If the 
Total Score ever exceeds the Target Score, the player loses, 
the losses counter is updated, and the game starts again.

The values of the four buttons are reported to the console.
